                 ALARM CLOCK
                 ===========

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

// Used to store the threads that are blocked. Threads are then removed from the list after they are unblocked
static struct list sleeping_threads;

// Compares the wakeup_ticks property of two threads
bool comp (const struct list_elem * a, const struct list_elem * b, void * aux UNUSED)

// Property used to determine when a thread is ready to be unblocked
int64_t wakeup_ticks;


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to your timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

The function first disabled interrupts and sets the wakeup_ticks property of the current thread to a future tick. 
The thread is then added to a list of blocked threads and then a call to thread_block() is made to block the current thread.

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

The steps taken to unblock threads are only looked at if the blocked thread list is not empty. Otherwise we just skip over it.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

By implementing locks within the timer_sleep function

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?

We use a lock_try_acquire in the timer_interupt function so that if the lock is already in use, the critical section is jut skipped. 


---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> other designs that you considered?

We tried to keep the design as simple as possible in an effort to reduce the number of places where problems could potentially occur.
There's no real guarantee that this is the most efficient way to solve this, since we could shorten our critical sections for the locks. 
However, it is superior in a sense that the number of things that could go wrong is kept to a minimum.


             PRIORITY SCHEDULING
             ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

// A lock that will serve to prevent multiple threads from colliding within timer_sleep and timer_interupt
static struct lock &sleeping_threads_lock; 

>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?

>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B6: Describe a potential race in thread_set_priority() and explain
>> how your implementation avoids it.  Can you use a lock to avoid
>> this race?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B7: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?


              ADVANCED SCHEDULER [EXTRA CREDIT]
              =================================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: Suppose threads A, B, and C have nice values 0, 1, and 2.  Each
>> has a recent_cpu value of 0.  Fill in the table below showing the
>> scheduling decision and the priority and recent_cpu values for each
>> thread after each given number of timer ticks:

timer  recent_cpu    priority   thread
ticks   A   B   C   A   B   C   to run
-----  --  --  --  --  --  --   ------

>> C3: Did any ambiguities in the scheduler specification make values
>> in the table uncertain?  If so, what rule did you use to resolve
>> them?  Does this match the behavior of your scheduler?

>> C4: How is the way you divided the cost of scheduling between code
>> inside and outside interrupt context likely to affect performance?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> C5: Briefly critique your design, pointing out advantages and
>> disadvantages in your design choices.  If you were to have extra
>> time to work on this part of the project, how might you choose to
>> refine or improve your design?
